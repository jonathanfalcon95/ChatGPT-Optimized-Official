ðŸ’¡ Publication Package

To publish your package to the npm registry, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a valid npm account. If you don't have one, create an account on the npm website.

2. Navigate to the root directory of your project in the terminal.

3. Run the following command to initialize your package:

```bash
npm init
```

This command will prompt you to enter information about your package, such as the name, version, description, and entry point. Fill in the required details accordingly.

4. Once the initialization is complete, you can verify that a `package.json` file has been created in your project directory.

5. Next, ensure that your package is properly configured by reviewing the `package.json` file. Make any necessary adjustments, such as adding dependencies or scripts.

6. Before publishing, it's a good practice to test your package locally. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies specified in your `package.json` file.

7. Once you're confident that your package is ready for publication, run the following command to publish it to the npm registry:

```bash
npm publish
```

This command will upload your package to the npm registry and make it available for others to install and use.

8. After a successful publication, you can view your package on the npm website by visiting `https://www.npmjs.com/package/your-package-name`, where `your-package-name` is the name you specified in your `package.json` file.

Congratulations! Your package is now published and ready for others to discover and utilize.

Remember to regularly update your package with new features, bug fixes, and improvements to provide the best experience for your users.
